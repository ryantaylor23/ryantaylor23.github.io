            <h2>Work Experience</h2>

             <p>I have a lot of experience in working physical jobs for the <strong>past 5 years</strong>. I have done various jobs such as cleaning windows, managing a tire store and building houses.<br> I believe that participating in these difficult, physically demanding jobs, have installed a strong work ethic in me. Which will help me in my efforts to become a successful software developer.<br> I have the patience and drive to complete tasks which are necessary for the career path I have chosen. I will not give up until the job is done. </p>
